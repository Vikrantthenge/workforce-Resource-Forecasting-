# 📊 Workforce & Resource Forecasting System  
### Excel • Python • Prophet • ARIMA • Power BI • Streamlit

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://forecasting-demo.streamlit.app/)

A complete end-to-end workforce planning solution combining operational logic, time-series forecasting, scenario modeling, and a lightweight deployable demo.  
This system forecasts workload, optimizes staffing, highlights SLA risks, and provides decision-readiness for operations teams.

---

## 📌 Project Summary
This repository demonstrates a real-world workflow for capacity planning and operational forecasting:

- Excel-based inputs for schedules, shrinkage, and SLA constraints  
- Python forecasting pipelines (Prophet & ARIMA) for 30-day forecasts  
- Cleaned CSV outputs consumed by a Power BI dashboard for scenario planning  
- A lightweight Streamlit forecasting demo to run models and download forecasts

Use cases: shift planning, staffing gap detection, SLA risk monitoring, backlog tracking, and what-if scenario simulation.

## 🔗 Live Demo
**Streamlit Forecasting Demo:** https://forecasting-demo.streamlit.app/

The demo allows upload of historical time-series, runs Prophet and/or ARIMA, compares metrics (MAE/RMSE), and provides downloadable forecast CSVs.

## 🧩 Dataset Details
Two main datasets in this project:

### 1. `workforce_forecast_dataset.csv` (Hourly — 180 days)
Columns include:
- `Timestamp` (datetime)  
- `ActualVolume` (numeric)  
- `RequiredAgents` (calculated)  
- `ScheduledStaff`  
- `AttendanceRate`  
- `AvailableStaff`  
- `Backlog`  
- `SLA_Met` (0/1)

### 2. `Workforce_Forecast_Final.csv` (Daily forecast — 30 days)
Generated by the Python forecasting pipeline and includes:
- `ds` (date), `y` (historical), `yhat` (forecast), `yhat_lower`, `yhat_upper`  
- `ForecastVolume`, `RequiredAgents`, `StaffingGap`, `SLA_Risk` (High/Low)

## 🧠 Solution Architecture

## 🧮 Python Forecasting Pipeline (Prophet + ARIMA)

### Steps:
1. Load hourly data  
2. Aggregate to daily series  
3. Fit Prophet  
4. Fit ARIMA  
5. Compare MAE / RMSE  
6. Export unified forecast CSV

### Prophet Example Code

```python
from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("workforce_forecast_dataset.csv", parse_dates=['Timestamp'])

daily = df.groupby(df['Timestamp'].dt.date)['ActualVolume'].sum().reset_index()
daily.columns = ['ds', 'y']

model = Prophet(daily_seasonality=True, weekly_seasonality=True)
model.fit(daily)

future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = model.predict(future)
forecast.to_csv("forecast_output_30days.csv", index=False)
